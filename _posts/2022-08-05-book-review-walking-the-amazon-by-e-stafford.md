<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm spending the entire year reading and writing on novels that are "journey-focused" as part of my 2022 writing challenge. I plunged into Ed Stafford's "Walking the Amazon" for my second book.</p>

<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are significant distinctions between planning to trek the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada and travelling the entire length of the Amazon River from Peru to Brazil. When Ed Stafford made the historic decision to walk the Amazon River, several factors had to be taken into consideration, including costs, guides, customs, the terrain, safety, and the length of the voyage. This is not to say that there aren't parallels between the two, and it all comes down to the preparation itself. Whether the voyage lasts six months or two years, there are phases that must be done, including establishing your financial position, finding your physical comfort zone, overcoming food and water shortages, and finding your mental sweet spot.</p>

<h3 id="the-odd-man-out">The Odd Man Out</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stafford had to rely on guides who knew the area well and could explain what he was seeing on the maps in order to undertake this voyage. Even when he was in a group of people, this frequently required him to overcome communication challenges and lengthy spells of loneliness. As I consider the journey I will soon do with a close friend, I worry about the scenarios in which, despite our best efforts, we encounter folks on the path with whom we don't click. According to what I've read, I'm confident that we will eventually form a hiking family that we can rely on to get to the northern terminus. I also know that we will interview candidates who have different personalities or who have more or less experience than us. I worry a lot about how to handle these situations without offending people.</p>

<h2 id="your-body-falling-apart">Your Body Falling Apart</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Amazon River, the Pacific Crest Trail, the Appalachian Trail, or any other long-distance trip are not designed for our modern selves. This entails deceiving your body into enduring discomfort, achy muscles, and mental suffering. Your body will be screaming to quit while everything is falling apart, but at the same time, it will be gaining stronger. In the end, the human body is a fairly wonderful thing capable of great things if tested, thus calves will strengthen, backs will tighten, feet will grow, and muscles will persevere. I'm sure a five-month trip will put mine to the test.</p>

<h3 id="boredom">Boredom</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is one aspect of thru-hiking that is frequently ignored in all the materials you read: boredom. This book does a fantastic job of covering the topic. It is natural for monotony and boredom to develop when we are required to do the same thing every day or choose to do it that way. My life will consist of sleeping, eating, hiking, sleeping, eating, hiking, and sleeping in a year. I'll need to find ways to amuse myself while hiking because I know that my love of nature alone won't keep me occupied. I'm thinking of adding something new to each of the following every day: reading, writing, recording video, podcasting, and audio books.</p>
