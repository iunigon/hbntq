<p>I'm spending the entire year reading and writing on novels that are "journey-focused" as part of my 2022 writing challenge. I read J.  Krakauer's "Walking the Amazon" as my third book.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Few challenges compare to climbing Mount Everest in this world. In the larger scheme of things, my next attempt to trek the Pacific Crest Trail in its entirety falls short. Still, both adventures must accomplish something similar. It will all hurt. Your mind will be screaming at you to give up. Every day will present a different challenge. I'll have to overcome myself in order to get through these moments. I'll have to pay attention to my body and take breaks when I can. I'll have to remind myself of why I set out to hike this far in the first place. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is little doubt that mishaps will occur on any wilderness excursion. I've ran out of water, myself. I seem to have lost my way. I brought a hefty pack with me on my journey. I've had to end hikes early due to tiredness. I've gone on hikes in the dark without any lights. Although each of these situations provided me with a chance to learn, they at the time compelled me to maintain my composure and consider my problems. However, despite the fact that these lessons pale in comparison to the sadness described in this book's account of the Everest climb, the same way of thinking is still evident.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We lead protected lives. We make the trip from home to work and return. Our excursions into the wild are transient. For some of us, our only encounters will be at local parks, beaches, or national parks. Only a few of us will opt for a prolonged engagement. Even fewer people will decide to devote their entire lives to it. No matter how involved you are, nature will continue its march whether we are around or not. It is made up of courage, harmony, balance, dismay, destruction, and life. It could be an ally or an adversary. Our fate is frequently determined by how we react and how we prepare. 2022 is the year I personally hope to wrestle with this line and prevail. I need to be aware of my position. I am steadfast in my respect and aware of the position of nature.</p>

<h3 id="overcoming-yourself">Overcoming Yourself</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every hiker's stay in the wilderness should be based on the principle of "Leave No Trace." It simply implies that nothing or anyone should ever be aware that you were there. You should take everything you brought, including all of your food and equipment, with you when you depart. As a result, the delicate balance between nature and humanity can continue to exist. When you read "Into Thin Air," you're reading about people who are determined to destroy nature in order to reach the highest point in the planet. Almost every square inch of each page is taken up by a mountainside covered in human waste, oxygen tanks, and the dead of the fallen. It is plenty to irritate and frustrate even the most docile lovers of nature.</p>
