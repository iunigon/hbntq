<p>This following essay will be all about part of my family’s history and how they journeyed to Canada from England. I’ll be interviewing my mother’s-side grandmother, Holly. While this is also an assignment for school, I feel like writing this essay and being able to connect with her more in the interview will be something fun and an amazing experience. I knew before the interview that Holly came over to Canada when she was around sixteen, but I <em>literally</em> knew nothing else about her journey or her life in England. I chose to interview her because I felt like she would have the story with the most intrigue and details; on my father’s side, they lived in northern Ontario for many generations, so there wouldn’t be as many interesting stories. I also hadn’t seen my grandmother for a long time with COVID, so interviewing her would be a chance to have a conversation with her about something that was important to both of us. I hope that this interview will help to maybe engage more conversations in the future about our family’s history.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holly was born on the twelfth of October, 1950, which makes her seventy-one in 2022. She prefers to go by “Holly,” and doesn’t use her actual first name. Her first name means “pearl,” according to her. Her mother liked the name, which was quite popular at the time, so she was named as it. Her second first name means ‘true’ or ‘faithful.’ Her mother’s name was also that, so she wanted to carry it over to the next generation and thought that it sounded nice.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holly was born in Kingston Upon Hull, England, which is frequently abbreviated to “Hull,” the name in which she called it. It’s a traditional port city in the north-east of England (Yorkshire) that has a population of around three-hundred thousand. This is where she grew up for almost all of her childhood, which was until she was 16, before moving to Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She didn’t really have many traditions that were unique or especially interesting; however, I know that some traditions that <em>I</em> celebrate came from her sharing them. For example, I know Holly celebrated Christmas &amp; Easter as her main holidays when she was younger, and something that my family does on Christmas is make edible ‘Christmas candles.’ These candles are made from a slice of pineapple (the base) with a hole in the middle and a slice on the side, a banana that fits into the hole (the ‘candlestick’) , an orange slice that fits into the slice (for the ‘handle’), and a raspberry on top (the ‘flame’). I know that this tradition came from her originally, as well as many others. She also said that one tradition or event that we don’t really celebrate here is <em>Guy Fawkes’ Night</em>, something that is traditionally British. This celebration is essentially Hallowe'en and is celebrated on November the 5th. They didn’t celebrate Hallowe’en because people previously believed that ‘pagans,’ which are usually considered members of non-traditional ‘cults,’ were the only ones that celebrated Hallowe’en and that the celebration was part of the ‘cult.’ She remembers it getting dark really early, having bonfires, and setting off fireworks during the evening and into the night. Holly's favourite celebration was Christmas because she got the presents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She doesn’t really remember any fiction or folklore stories being told to her as a child; at least nothing that was interesting. She remembers reading all the <em>Noddy &amp; Big Ears </em>books — a series that is banned now for having racist content. Sadly, like many things in society, especially a few decades ago, the riddled were racially-stereotyping people; but were still normalized into everyday life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She never really tried to learn any languages other than English, but in school there were some smaller (Parisian) French classes that she took, so she knew some words. Holly also studied Latin in school, but, as she puts it, “that’s not a language that we normally speak [nowadays].”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her most-memorable event as a child was probably, according to her, moving to Canada. Obviously, this was a huge change in her life; she had to leave behind many people and move to a whole other <em>continent</em> to start a life in a city she probably had never heard of before moving. However, this was not the only major event that stood out to her when she was younger; she had also moved to the United States for a year before coming to Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The developments or changes that changed her life are also the major moves. Obviously, moving to Canada changed her life — for the better or the worse. She moved from one continent to another, one being a small-ish island country, and one being the largest country in the world aside from Russia. They both have different cultures, landscapes, history, languages, etc.; understandably, this was the biggest development. She also said, though, that staying in the U.S. for a year helped her understand the world through the vast differences between the three countries that she’s lived in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had to move to the U.S. because her father was a professor in England and was granted a sabbatical — a type of ‘vacation’ given to professors who have worked for long enough; these can be either for leisure or to study in another spot, while still being paid. The sabbatical was to study and teach in another university that was in Rochester, New York. She got to live there with her family for around a year, before returning to England slightly before moving to Canada. Her life there was extremely different from both Canada and Britain, as she puts it. Their education system in the U.S was really distinct from England’s; apparently there, no one really spent any of their time on schoolwork, which was contrary to what she experienced in England. It probably wasn’t a good school. They also were very ‘patriotic,’ at least quite a bit more than in the U.K, as she puts it. Every morning, the students would pledge their allegiance to the flag in class, which was surprising; in Britain, at the school that she went to, they would have a morning assembly where they would sing hymns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nowadays, Holly is retired. She previously worked as a professor at the University of Guelph, like her father, in the department of animal and poultry science; she’s written multiple academic studies on the subject.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before moving to Canada and the U.S, she had actually moved while still in England. When she was a small child — about three years old — she moved closer to the ‘country’ or farmland. Her parents previously had a house closer to the inner part of town, nearer to the suburbs, but they bought a new one slightly after she was born. They had previously lived in the first house since they got married and moved in together, but bought the new one to make more space for their growing family; they especially wanted a house with lots of backyard space. So, they bought&nbsp; a one-and-a-third-acre plot of empty space and commissioned a house to be built for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once Holly learned of how she would be moving to Canada, she was immediately disappointed. Moving to another continent with very little chance of coming back in the coming years would mean permanently leaving her friends. She had many friends at school, especially one really good one, so she really didn’t want to leave them behind. Leaving them behind in the end ended up making her quite unhappy, and she cried a lot when she was leaving. Holly remembers thinking that she would do all she could to make sure that she got back to England as soon as possible, once she got to Canada. If she left England as well, she would leave behind her grandparents, something she was also really sad about; she never did see them again once she arrived. That was probably really tough for her. In the end though, she <em>was </em>certainly glad that she came. Apparently, she never really wanted to live anywhere else instead, though; not in another country or province.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holly travelled by air to go from Britain to Canada, during a time period that is commonly&nbsp; referred to as the ‘jet age’; in which commercial-airline travel was becoming more and more popular. She doesn’t remember what the flight was exactly like; the whole time she was quite sad and worried about leaving her home, so evidently she wasn’t examining and looking around the plane. However, she does think that, back then, like today, you still got food on the plane.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The journey was done with her parents — her mother; her father, the professor — and her sisters — Helen and Barbra, who were twins and were older; and Cathy, who was recently adopted and was still a baby. She doesn’t know how much it cost exactly, but she assumes it must have been a lot; she also thinks that her father’s work (the University of Guelph) probably paid for the journey, because, as she puts it, “they’ll do that sort of thing for professors that they really want.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She doesn’t remember the exact route, but she knows that she flew into the Toronto international airport, which is around one hundred kilometers from Guelph, which was where she was going. Her parents had already pre-rented a house there before the trip, so they simply drove to it. While driving, the ‘first’ major thing that she noticed was the abundance of greenspace and trees in between the cities. In England, she was used to having little-to-no greenspace between cities; as she puts it, “you get out of one city, and you’re almost immediately in another.” She said it wasn’t really a good year, having just moved, but she said that the maple trees were something that she found really interesting and beautiful were the maple trees; there were none and England, and she’d at least never seen so many together, especially during the fall, where they would all change colour. I can understand how seeing the whole forests change to beautiful orang-ey colours in a few days when you’ve never seen or heard of it before must be an amazing experience. Another thing that she noticed was the lack of pollution in Canada; even in Toronto, Canada’s biggest city, the pollution levels were still ‘quite a bit’ lower than in Hull. The city and countryside smelled ‘nice’ and weren’t filled with smog or other pollutants like in Britain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She finally did arrive at her new home, which is only a couple of streets away from where she lives now, and probably started — at least after a couple years — to change her mind about wanting to move back to England. As she said in the interview, Canada really was beautiful. There was no pollution and it wasn’t as crowded as it was in England; the country was ‘big and beautiful,’ with amazing scenery — the Great Lakes, the mountains. The summers were ‘nice and warm,’ and it wasn’t always raining like in Britain; but the winters were quite different. There was tons of snow, something that was relatively unusual to come in large amounts back in England, and she had never experienced the extreme levels of cold that are common in Canada.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yes, in the end, today, she never regrets the decision. She says in the interview that she “absolutely does not wish [to have stayed in Britain].” She also still believes that Canada is the one country that she’d still like to live in; Holly has family in Vancouver, so leaving them behind as well would not be something that she’d like to do.</p>

<p>I’ve learned a lot from this essay. I really didn’t have any idea of what it would feel like to move from one vastly different <em>continent</em> to another, but with what my grandmother said throughout the interview, I can at least have a sense of what it would feel like to leave my friends behind to a country that is forty times bigger than the one that I used to live in. I’ve also learned how beautiful Canada is, from an outsider’s perspective. I’ve heard many times on TV or elsewhere that Canada is beautiful and its scenery is amazing, but I’ve never really thought about it being so drastically different from other countries; I’ve never had any first-hand account about what the experience was really like. I feel like I have learned that living in Canada really is something amazing and something I should not take for granted.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, in conclusion, this interview was really something that I’m happy about happening. I’ve learned <em>so</em> much about my family’s history and their journey to Canada. I understand that this is quite important, because if anything different had happened, it would have made me have a very different life. I’ve connected with my grandmother (and grandfather) through this interview, and I got to have a conversation with them that I haven't really had before. I’m really happy that we ended up having this interview and that I had the opportunity to reflect and learn while writing this essay. Thank you for the opportunity.</p>
