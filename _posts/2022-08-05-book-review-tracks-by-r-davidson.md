<p>I'm spending the entire year reading and writing on novels that are "journey-focused" as part of my 2022 writing challenge. I started reading "Tracks" by Robyn Davidson as my first book.</p>

<p>2,650 miles of hiking doesn't need a reason. One can only adore the idea of trekking, fighting with oneself to achieve the unimaginable, and collaborating with nature to accomplish one's ultimate objective. All that is actually needed is this. I need the pull of something greater than myself. This isn't just a hike, though. This is an exam. It has been about budgeting, research, finding the correct gear, getting in shape, and preparing my life for a 6-month vacation ever since I made the decision to embark on this voyage. It also serves as a test of deeper qualities such as manliness, spirituality, simplicity, and the very nature of the world.</p>

<p>Every hiker will be faced with the possibility of giving up whether they are hiking the Pacific Crest Trail or the Australian Outback. Money can be scarce. Injuries may manifest. You might succumb to time or the path might reduce you to a shell of the person you once were. These are all highly probable scenarios. It requires a will that the modern world hardly ever puts to the test to overcome them. I'm hoping to trek with folks who inspire me to keep going because we all have this in common. I also hope I can help them in the same way.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's something I've tried doing more than once. People with far greater talent than I do have waxed poetic about it. However, we have all fallen short of accurately describing nature to some extent. We may have created a vibrant universe with our wonderful words, but the granger hasn't been adequately caught. With all of our efforts, we managed to create a tapestry that falls short of the original. Experiences in nature should be personal. It calls for experiencing deep sea dives, snow-capped mountains, flowing streams, still lakes, and the abundance of life. You can only discover the appropriate words for yourself at that point.</p>

<p>How does it feel to have successfully traversed the Australian Outback? Is it the Appalachian Trail? The Trail of the Continental Divide? What is the Pacific Crest Trail? How does it feel to start in Mexico and end in Canada? I can only imagine at this time. Knowing that my dreams are far from becoming reality, I can only imagine what it must feel like. Then I consider how it would feel to leave the route, get in a car, and return to reality. How do those times feel? I'm not sure and won't be for a while, but I can't wait.</p>
