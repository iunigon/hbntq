<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm spending the entire year reading and writing on novels that are "journey-focused" as part of my 2022 writing challenge. I dove into Sarah Marquis' "Wild by Nature" as my sixth book.</p>

<p>Compared to the thought of trying the same endeavour in a foreign country, the concept of hiking around here doesn't sound intimidating. Different cultural norms and practises from my own reveal a level of intricacy that is really different from the trip I am planned. Despite the differences, I can respect the planning that domestic and international thru-hikers share, including familiarizing themselves with the route, water caches, first aid, rest stations, knowing when to bail, etc.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1659791177332_852">Several times in this book, Sarah was by herself on a route in the middle of nowhere. I've gone hiking by myself before, but never totally by myself. There were additional hikers, campers, and/or travellers in the area. On the path, I've never encountered this degree of seclusion, and the notion of it terrifies me. Not being alone is what terrifies me. That which is unknown. What if a wild animal encounter goes tragically wrong? What if I become sick or hurt? Suppose I get lost? I am not sure whether I will ever be able to overcome these concerns, while knowing that careful planning, letting others know where you are, and trial by fire are the only ways to do so.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1659791177332_859">During Sarah’s journey, she was forced to leave the trail for an extended period and evaluate a better plan for finishing her journey. This is something that really worries me when doing long-distance hikes such as these. Building up all this "excitement" for this hike, only to have to skip a large part of it. Many will keep going. But lots will completely skip the possibly problematic area. Whenever I'm hiking, I obviously want to finish the trail. If I don't, it leaves me feeling like I didn't even do <em>anything</em>. For me, the journey and the experience would be quite diminished if I couldn't walk every kilometre.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1659791177332_861">Sarah's trip came to an end under a little tree in Australia's wilderness. She did the best she could to capture the feelings of that instant, but I know that is essentially impossible. Although I have no firsthand experience with it, I am aware that words frequently fail us in life's most meaningful moments. I also understand that this is particularly true when striving to convey the magnificence and beauty of nature. When my voyage is over, I'm sure I'll sit down to write and ultimately fail to capture the moment.</p>
