<p>I'm spending the entire year reading and writing on novels that are "journey-focused" as part of my 2022 writing challenge. I read Jonathan Raban's "Driving Home" as my fourth book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book was interesting point of view; I wasn't born or have lived in this US, so a book about "niches" of specific parts was quite an interesting — in a good way — read. I learned about fascinating parts of the USA while still being indulged in a classic "journey" story from a different point of view,</p>

<p>It was tough to avoid thinking about what first drew me to the Pacific Northwest while reading "Driving Home." I came to this conglomeration of states hanging in the wild left-hand corner of the United States, like countless others before me and all those who followed in the well-worn path trodden by us, with a desire to be closer to nature and define life on my own terms. My understanding of that migration and what it means to call a place home was challenged by Raban's book.</p>

<h3 id="seattle-washington">Seattle, Washington</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seattle straddles the line between a large city and a small village. Locals frequently complain about a lost sense of charm while newcomers push progress forward as a result of this tug-of-war between the two. Beyond its proximity to nature and the political and religious comfort I find there, this conservative and liberal interpretation of what this city means has given birth to what I most value about this area. I love finding myself being both a force for change and wanting the closeness of small-town life. I'm excited and at ease in this dynamic.</p>

<h3 id="the-sea-in-seattle">The sea in Seattle</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is difficult to avoid losing oneself in the sea when one lives in Seattle. With Puget Sound right outside your door and the Pacific Ocean only a short drive away, it's easy to lose yourself in thoughts of what lies beyond the horizon. Even while I like the convenience and quickness of flying, I can't help but picture living on the open sea, where every location seems both close by and too far away to fully comprehend at the same time. I find this dissonance to be almost as captivating as the start of a hiking trail.</p>

<h3 id="the-left-coast">The "Left" Coast</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seattle is a bastion of liberalism. Political realities are being played out within its walls right now. On a map of the nation, we can observe blue zones surrounding the largest cities and red-hued rural areas. This trend can be seen in the conflict between Seattle and the remainder of Washington state. You can more strongly sense this struggle of wills as you get farther into the suburbs. Here, being both morally liberal and fiscally conservative takes on genuine significance. This is just another reason why I adore this city, in my opinion. There are arguments everywhere, and as an Oklahoman guy, I tend to go with the majority.</p>
