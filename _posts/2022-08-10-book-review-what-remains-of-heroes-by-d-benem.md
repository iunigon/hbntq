<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was skimming through some old docs that I had far down in my Drive, and I came across this review. I don't remember why I chose this book (although I'm pretty sure it was a recommendation after it came out), nor why I haven't decided to actually publish it yet. I think I wrote it on a snowy day in the winter after finding it in a used book store. This was a decent review for me at the time, in my opinion, although it was really only a draft and certainly doesn't follow my current style in the slightest.  It's also really long, so I imagine some of you might not actually want to read it in full. Either way, happy reading!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="should-you-read-it">Should you read it?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have the guts to endure a ludicrous opening and the occasional writing hiccup, I'd suggest this to grimdark addicts eager for their next fix. The plot is primarily character-driven and there are consequences of every action performed, which is fairly in accordance with the concept of contemporary grimdark writing, despite having a background of an old, epic war. I attempted to come up with a similar book to end this paragraph with, and <em>Godblind</em> by Anna Stephens is actually the one that comes to mind. Although the two books are very different, there are some big similarities here, so I suppose if you liked <em>Godblind</em>, you might like this one as well. In reality, it really is quite a traditional fantasy book, with some witty twists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The books also have a few partially despicable, distant point-of-view characters (well, all of them, actually). You might like to read this if you enjoyed <em>The Court of Broken Knives</em> or <em>The Heresy Within</em> (working on reviews).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="plot-synopsis">Plot synopsis</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The troubles of Lannick deVeers, a former hero who disobeyed the kingdom's most powerful commander, are described in the official "blurb." DeVeers afterwards became a bitter alcoholic with a dead family. It would lead you to conclude that Lannick would be a classic "revenge" story with the general in question, but the truth is surprisingly very different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In reality, the plot would be better summarized something like this: The ancient kingdom of Rune was established with the help of its goddess Illiene (or something similar), and her immortal Sentinels swore to protect the High King dynasty. Heroes built in difficult times gave rise to the kingdom, but as is often the case, difficult times tend to pass and be replaced by peace. Rune's adversaries gathered throughout the years in the shadows and planned to take advantage of her weakness. As it happens with peace, the High Kings became tolerant and weak and exiled the Sentinels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The country is currently under threat from an attack from abroad, but the High King is elderly and insane, the church of Illiene is weak, the aristocracy is divided, and the court is filled with conspiracies. A disgraced hero makes a comeback and confronts his tumultuous past in the midst of this developing storm. A load too heavy to bear is placed on a professor who despises all human contact, but carrying it is necessary if his church is to succeed. A group of mercenaries then attempts to take advantage of the situation, but they end up suffering greatly as a result of their vicious deeds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="quality-and-execution">Quality and execution</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, this book's opening chapter is really awful. There is simply no escaping the truth. Before a pair of "well-dressed, beautiful ladies" enter the bar and take Lannick out, the opening scene involves some stupid, forced, unrealistic discussion between Lannick and his friend. In addition, Lannick's former foe and formidable general was one of the ladies' father. However, the ladies were unaware. The general then captures them. But Lannick gets away. However, the general's men grab him again, and the general immediately reveals his most top-secret intentions since that's what bad guys do, isn't it? It's really cringy, to be completely honest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(And by the way, he casually spills out his most top-secret, high-treason intentions on a busy street, just like that. Absolutely what would really happen.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm not sure if the book was edited; if so, the author might want to use a better contractor the next time. If not, congratulations to the author—the remainder of the book was surprisingly excellent. After the first few pages, the writing, conversation, and overall quality all dramatically improved, and in the end, I was mostly glad I didn't put the book down right away. The book has many points of view — something that can be annoying, allow for jaw-dropping cliffhangers, or, most of the time, is something that really improves the quality of the book — and the chapters alternate between them. The only drawback is that the opening chapters are somewhat lengthy (20 pages on average — which, sometimes, can get boring and distrating), and by the time we return to Lannick and <em>his</em> story from chapter 1, a significant portion of the book has already passed. In other words, even if the reader was riveted by that chapter, by the time the plot line picks back up, their attention will have already waned (or forgotten about the previous stuff) because greater things have happened since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The remainder of the narrative was rather surprising and well-handled. Rarely did I know what to anticipate. The fights, which I considered to be incredibly realistic in contrast to the comic book- and video-game-like material I so abhor in writing that purports to be serious, were a major plus. Here, there is no room for frivolity; the battles are vicious, and you can almost always predict a fatal outcome.<em> The First Law </em>and <em>Among Thieves</em> (read that book if you appreciate realistic sword work; it doesn't get any better than that) both have battles that are incredibly obvious as to what is going in each step of the combat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The constant theme of ordinary, believable, morally dubious people being forced to make decisions by the "good" and "bad" sides, and how the judgments made were always within character but not always the right ones, and that every decision had an effect, was what I liked most about this novel. It really helps change up the "traditional fantasy" feel of the story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although I would like to point out that the book doesn't have a clear conclusion and reads more like a setup for a larger narrative that, most likely, will take place in the sequel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="the-setting">The Setting</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book has a really well-detailed, well-thought-out setting. Although I'm not typically a fan of fictional maps, in this instance, even a crude illustration of the locations would greatly enhance my reading experience. While the story only takes place inside the boundaries of the kingdom of Rune, there are still numerous fiefdoms (called Thanes), and a bunch of cities, as well as a vast wilderness and rural areas, as well as ancient ruins, rivers, and a sea, and more cities on the other side of that sea. There are also mentions of deserts and exotic nations, as well as a plethora of kingdoms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there is the issue of religion. The aforementioned church in Illiene is a dying organization, and the uninformed populace refers to its clergy as Spookers. Fairy tales about actions that are hardly remembered are not commonly believed, and the church essentially accepted that it would go into obscurity. Its influence is waning, and there is even division among its ranks. And throughout that time, its archives have been home to a number of sinister secrets that are concealed between the pages of illegal books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Necrists and their navigators, an ancient religion that uses the shadowpaths, are other creatures that lurk in the shadows. It is only possible for them to travel from site A into the emptiness outside of the world and then emerge at location B if there is a shadow connecting both of those locations. The idea of shadowpaths appealed to me because it had some exciting ramifications for battling these monsters. Additionally, there is a historic order that stands for the "Good" side and competes with the Necrists. There are also Sentinels, who are said to be good. There is also treason. That's cool. Now, starting to go any farther will begin to spoil the story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="the-characters">The Characters</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As explained before, this is a POV book; the three main points of view in this book are — Lannick, the disillusioned war hero; Zandrachus Bale, the reclusive scholar of the religion of Illiene; and Fencress, the assassin; and are interwoven throughout. I'll concentrate on these for a moment before conclusion</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5 id="lannick">Lannick</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a stunning rise and an even more spectacular fall, his family was slain, and his name was loathed by his erstwhile allies, the main theme of his narrative is self-discovery. The most notable aspect of Lannick's personality was his alcoholism; as he tried to get his stuff together, this led to many internal problems, and, although maybe he wasn't the most interesting character, this led to a fairly interesting plot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5 id="zandrachus">Zandrachus</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zandrachus was a more fascinating individual. He hated people in general and only found comfort in old books and older secrets contained in those old volumes, the mysteries I previously described. He reluctantly does his church obligations, and when he receives a hidden note with an urgent request for assistance and the suggestion of treason in high places, he responds as one might anticipate from such a hermit, analysing and overthinking until it is too late. I think that this character could probably be pretty relatable to a fair amount of people. Additionally, he is a <em>thinker</em> rather than a do-er. note In one scene, he considers assassinating his opponent while they are sleeping but decides against it. He then considers where to stab the man to quickly end his life but backs off once more. It was a stark contrast to the other POVs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5 id="fencress">Fencress</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A strong woman with a dark past who remains faithful to her pal Karnag despite his madness and deadly rampage. She has little idea of what she is up against, but she always takes a chance. She is quite the gambler, betting both her crewmates' <em>lives</em> and dice. I had a fair amount of trouble empathising with her character, to be honest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5 id="character-closing">Character closing</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one to truly root for can be a persistent problem for some audiences. Despite the impending battle between good and evil, the "heroes" in this story are shattered individuals with their own ambitions. They are definitely shady characters, yet something was missing from them that would have allowed the typical bookworm to relate with them. There are books like this, and those works also have audiences (for instance, <em>The Court of Broken Knives</em>, although I'd say I preferred this book over those other two.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, and there is one more character-related drawback: sadly, none of the key characters really cross paths throughout the novel, which is something that probably should've happened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a self-published, "classic" fantasy, book, this was surprisingly-well executed. Aside from the few cringe-worthy lines that were clearly just put in there so the rest could flow all right, the book itself was decent and included a fair amount of wittiness and subtle references. Overall, I'd say I liked it.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book that I reviewed is called "What Remains of Heroes" by David Benem and was published in 2015.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>From Google Books (official blurb):</strong></em><br><em>Lannick deVeers used to be somebody. A hero, even. Then, he ran afoul of the kingdom's most powerful general and the cost he paid was nearly too much to bear. In the years that followed, his grief turned him into a shadow of his former self, and he spent his days drowning his regrets in tankards of ale. But now an unexpected encounter casts Lannick upon an unlikely path to revenge. If he can just find the strength to overcome the many mistakes of his past, he can seize the chance to become a hero once more. And with an ancient enemy lurking at the kingdom's doorstep, he'd better...</em></p>
