<p>Run on WordPress with a redirect domain <a href="https://yeahgames.pro">https://yeahgames.pro</a> purchased by a member and managed by the yEAdministrative team (which includes a few other members and I), this website archives all the information, announcements and more from our server for safekeeping and so they are accessible to all, with this "about":</p>

<h6 id="about">About</h6>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The yEAh Games archives are a system designed to make sure we (yEAh Games) never lose important data. It will often be used in Ycourt trials as evidence, or as research documents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://yeaharchives.wordpress.com/">Home</a>&nbsp;is where anything, no matter the subject, shows up that was recently archived. Use that for the most up-to-date information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also sort all of our archives into categories; click on the ‘menu’ buttons at the top of the page to view all the different categories of archives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anything important will be recorded in its separate article here. If you need any information relating to yEAh Games that it is not in the server, you’ll find it here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We may also post special, this-site-only information here; make sure to check frequently.<br><br>If you are a yEAh Games employee (or member) and would like to archive information for this site, visit <a href="https://yeaharchives.wordpress.com/start-archiving/">this page</a>.<br><br><strong>Additional:</strong><br>⠀• For one, if you needed to see any information about anything yEAh Games-related, you had to go onto the Discord. There was no other option. <br>⠀• Secondly, as more and more features were added, channels started to appear quite frequently, and eventually started to <em>clutter</em> the server. <br>⠀• Third, finding information is much easier now, with search features and everything in one spot, without having to go combing through thousands of messages. <br>⠀• Fourth, this way, nothing can be erased. If someone purposefully or accidentally erases important information in the server, it cannot be retrieved. Having information somewhere else, safe, is a good thing.</p>
