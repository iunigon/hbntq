<p>It is the first time that I've actually taken the time to go through and thoroughly analyze a book (not just take a quick look and connect it at some of the books that are relevant to my life; then just publish it with adding too much personal touch), and this book seemed like the perfect choice. It's more of a "random" choice, but it also feels quite significant now, and I'm hoping to start, along with my normal writing challenges, more reviews of older books and ones at least loosely based on real-life events. <br>I don't always like reviewing films based on such "classic" novels like this, but I have seen it and some elements and here reference it. I might do a full review soon. Happy reading!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The industrial revolution has been deeply divisive from its very origins. The objections stated at the beginning of this new order—most memorably by Charles Dickens—concern worker exploitation, pollution, deeper cultural issues of commodification, etc. In one of Dickens' publications, Gaskell's novel about an upper-class young woman who moves to an industrial heartland was first serialised. The protagonist, Margaret, was the name Gaskell originally intended for the book, but Dickens suggested a different name. The story is best characterised by this Tale of Two Titles since it is both a character study and a social critique intertwined.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Helstone, in the south of England, Margaret Hale is the daughter of a clergyman. Her cousin Edith, whose brother is a lawyer and has feelings for Margaret, is getting married to army captain Lennox. This early cast, which already includes the moms of Margaret and Edith, is an intriguing group of people as well as a set of archetypal figures. For instance, the military, the clergy, and the law are all represented. The two aunts present, on the one side, a lady who married for love and wanted greater material comforts (Mrs. Shaw, now widowed) and a woman who married for wealth and wanted love (Mrs Hale). This engaging usage of flat characters may be well known to Dickens readers.</p>

<p>You hardly ever need to look between the lines to understand what is happening because the novel is written using both (omniscient) narration and dialogue that is quite eloquent in portraying characters' emotions and intentions. This is made clearer in the chapters that come after Edith's wedding, in which we learn more about the Hales' love for Helstone, witness Captain Lennox's brother's confession to Margaret and her rejection, and hear Mr. Hale declare his separation from the Church of England in order to take a job as a tutor in Milton-Northern (pseudo-Manchester). Margaret now, of course, hates people who are in Trade, as is reasonable and proper. For those who are unaware, being upper class during the Victorian era meant avoiding employment outside of the military, church, or legal professions, as noted above. The working class, who were naturally subject to the kindly condescension of the nobility, were those who were gainfully employed in whatever duty, as is undoubtedly the case in idyllic Helstone. The entrepreneurs of this era, who own and run successful businesses and would later be referred to as capitalists, are, however, beneath contempt.</p>

<p>In Milton, we come across a few more archetypes, including Mr. Thornton, the factory owner, Nicholas Higgins, the union labourer, Bessy Higgins, his adolescent daughter who passed away from respiratory problems brought on by working in the factory, and Mr. Thornton's mother and sister, the former rendered spineless and vapid by a life of luxury.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the beginning of a tale about Margaret, a woman of great character and integrity who transforms the lives of those around her while also being transformed by Milton as she navigates between the North and the South. It definitely nails the mark in many respects, but I won't give away what the story has to say about industrial civilization. With Margaret being a devout Christian and Nicholas, Bessy, and Mr. Hale all expressing their own opinions, faith also plays a significant part in the narrative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first warning I would offer about this narrative is that the romance, which you could anticipate from this genre, is only passably good. It is somewhat realistic because the conventional heroine is obliged to conform despite her strong sense of independence. Second, the reader today will not find Margaret's brother Frederick's contribution to the storyline to be particularly interesting because he is largely missing from the narrative. Instead, it disrupts the flow of a quarrel that currently seems to be Much Ado About Nothing.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above all, <em>North and South</em> and its ideologies humanise the class struggle by giving it a face and a heart and by treating it with compassion. It's also about how a woman might be useful in this new century, rather than merely industrialisation and class conflict. It just attempts to make a small difference in the lives of its characters and, hopefully, the readers as well. It makes no grand claims about solving anything.</p>

<p>The book that I reviewed is called "North and South" by Elizabeth Glaskell and was published in 1884.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><em><strong>From Wikipedia:</strong></em><br><em>North and South&nbsp;is a&nbsp;social novel&nbsp;published in 1854 by English writer&nbsp;Elizabeth Gaskell. With&nbsp;Wives and Daughters&nbsp;(1865) and&nbsp;Cranford&nbsp;(1853), it is one of her best-known novels and was adapted for television three times (1966, 1975 and 2004). The&nbsp;2004 version&nbsp;renewed interest in the novel and attracted a wider readership. Initially, Gaskell wanted the novel to be titled after the heroine, Margaret Hale, but&nbsp;Charles Dickens, the editor of Household Words, the magazine in which the novel was serialized, insisted on&nbsp;North and South.</em></p>
