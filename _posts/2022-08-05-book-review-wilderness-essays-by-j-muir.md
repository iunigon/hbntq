<p>I'm spending the entire year reading and writing on novels that are "journey-focused" as part of my 2022 writing challenge. I read John Muir's "Wilderness Essays" as my fifth book.</p>

<p>Again, this book is theoretically based in the USA, but to be completely fair, it doesn't have to be. The book could take place anywhere if a few words were changed; but either way, the message — a really powerful one — stays the same. Besides, I enjoy looking at stuff from other perspectives, so I'm always happy to try a book from somewhere else.</p>

<h3 id="preparation">Nature and being in the moment</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm at fault. I have a habit of not living in the present. I've rushed for my phone in my pocket or my camera in my bag whenever I've reached a ridgeline while hiking in an effort to capture the expansive view in front of me. I snatched the experience from the present to save it for later; another item I can boast about when I return to reality. After reading this book, I really want to stop doing this habit. Instead, I want to be overcome by the intensity of the moment and realize how lucky I am to be in the presence of such beauty. I can only capture that feeling once I can realize the problem.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-we-hold">The Power We Hold</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We could move mountains if we only had the faith of a mustard seed, I've heard it stated; although I'm not necessarily believing of the power of faith, we have harmed the air, sea, waterways, and land with our power. Our ecosystem will become even more chaotic as a result of a factor like climate change. We all have the capacity to both create and destroy. I fervently hope that when the warning bells start to ring, everyone will realize that immediate action is required. If we don't, our beloved natural escapes will suffer unthinkable repercussions. It's <em>us</em> that has to fix this; we control the world in the sense that if we don't act, we won't have it.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-of-nature">The Power of Nature</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are not important to nature. Before we emerged from the primordial muck of our birth, it already stood. It will continue to stand long after we are gone, scarred by our presence. It functions despite the turmoil and discovers order everywhere. It is strong and calls for our complete respect. We would all be dumb to treat it any other way. In spite of this, we continue to push her to the brink, testing her resolve like a high school bully who is unaware of when to give up. Friends, if John Muir taught me anything, it's that nature is what I support. She will be a force to be reckoned with when she strikes back. This is a really powerful book.</p>

<h3 id="national-parks">National parks</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A playground as liberating as our national parks has never existed for me. The world is mine right here. For me, such rivers, paths, streams, and mountains resemble sandboxes, slides, swings, and monkey bars. They are the things I love most about this country and the areas that need our protection the most. This feeling is strengthened in me after reading Muir. John Muir understood that after each visit, I am permanently transformed; his entire gospel is based on that idea. I consider myself to be a believer now.</p>
