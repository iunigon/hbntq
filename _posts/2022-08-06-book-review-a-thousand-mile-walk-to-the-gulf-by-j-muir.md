<p>I'm spending the entire year reading and writing on novels that are "journey-focused" as part of my 2022 writing challenge. I dove into John Muir's "A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf" as my seventh book.</p>

<p>John Muir is revered in the hiking community and among those who love the outdoors. His numerous adventures—including his arduous trek to the Gulf of Mexico, time spent in the Sierra Mountain Range in California, and many others—have immortalized his name. His ability to pause and refer to everything by its correct name struck me as significant when I read about his travels through the American South. Each flower, tree, and plant that was seen had a name. This strikes me as powerful. He is showing respect by doing this. This is taking a break to reflect on the present. You are doing your best to keep a mental inventory of everything, since nature deserves our respect in all of its forms.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1659791177332_852">Muir spent a lot of time on the ground, down low, examining what was going on between the grass blades or between the fallen leaves on the forest floor due to the ongoing cataloguing. It was equally exciting to him as what was going on above. The majority of us use this area only as a means of transportation. But it shouldn't be. Once more, we should admire and think about the space between tree trunks. I vow to do a better job of living in the present, from the forest floor to the tree canopy above my head, after reading this book.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1659791177332_859">Soon after the Civil War, John Muir set off on his expedition through the American south. The South he encountered was in ruins and struggling to recover and accept what had happened. Slavery had been abolished and formerly-enslaved people had gained their freedom and were attempting to start new lives. We encounter intolerance, prejudice, racism, and stupidity as Muir travels; some of it ends up at our hero's feet. I did my best to interpret this in context as a reader. His descriptions of people, though, were difficult for me to read and unsettling. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this book simply because of the blatant racism and unsettling prejudice that really is sickening, but for an outdoorsy person, some stuff in it can be interesting.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1659791177332_861">I aim to start comprehending this man's legacy and the influence he had on the conservation movement in the United States by potentially walking the John Muir route. I can only read his essays now and let them influence how I see this event until that time. He has unquestionably helped me slow down and appreciate the privilege of being able to stand in these stunning places more. Despite the fact that I don't like him personally, his environmental initiatives in the US deserve praise.</p>

<p><em>This is one of my short review articles that I hope to release every time I complete a book (once every three days, at its best), notably any books relating to my current challenge. They are quick and hopefully fun to read, and they can really help build your perspective, while including my connections and personal beliefs, contrary to long articles where they are fully analyzed. Long, in-depth reviews are published weekly. Other formats are published randomly along with these articles. I recommend following the blog or checking out the homepage to find more interesting reads.</em></p>
